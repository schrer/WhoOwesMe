# WhoOwesMe

Created during the [Refugees Code Hackathon](http://www.refugeescode.at/hackathon/) 2018.
Working but incomplete by far.
Not maintained, so don't try to run it on a machine available on public internet.

## Running the application

Start the server by running *node server/index.js*.
Then start the client by running *ng serve --open* in the folder Client and the web application will be launched in your browser.
